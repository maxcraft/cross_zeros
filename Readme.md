This is a simple implementation of a simple game. However I tried to define four difficulties: _noob_, _easy_, _normal_, _hard_. In all difficulties except _hard_ the player has a first move.

The build process looks simple

```make```

There is no need in more complex tools for now.

```make clean```

The command above will remove all artefacts generated during compilation process.

### TODO:
* change difficulties without leaving the program.
* use arrow keys in ncurses mode.
* add ability to exit game and change mode during the game.
